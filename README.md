small joke project to generate image based on path

LICENSE? I barely know her?

256 emoji atlas was generated by patching this commit (will not provide patch, because why somebody needs it, just run build_image.php and follow errors):

# NEW IDEA:
true random is not that funny, so:

Add variants of paintings to draw:
- with one big object in the center
    - optional text here and in other variants
- 2-6 characters with optional text bubbles
    - 4 images with same characters, so it will be like comics
    - various sizes
    - objects could be flipped
    - objects could be placed:
        - grid, same depth
        - grid, perspective
        - circle, same depth
        - circle, perspective
        - one object in center, others in grid or circle
    - space between objects could also be  random or with patterns:
        - near
        - far
- 2-4 crowds of characters with different depths
- average or border color used as main color of something like sky, ground, sea, so it looks like some kind of landscape
    - could be background for other styles
- pop art like; with different color filters for each square
- mix multiple images on borders to make some kind of mattpainting(?)
- place two characters really next to each other so it looks that they are in love
- markov chain teached on pixel rows or columns of emotes, so it could output glitched images
- something like plant, tree, creature, but this could look either too similar, either too awful

should I process emotes? Probably no, it could be funnier because they are rectangular, also processing every emoji would be hard, i could transform them in some styles, but just using cropping without content assumptions

Add filters to apply after image drawn:
    - symmetries: | - +
    - color filters (but might be ugly)

generating text with carrot? if it will be not that slow with sqlite probably yes; also I am not sure if I can run go code on pythonanywhere free instance

add carrot to every painting as a signture

url controls:
- seed
- number of groups
- number of objects
- filters, but it could be probably be a mess
- it could move groups probably
- it could iterate over characters
- it could change a style or start a new picture on top? also could be a mess
- it could draw geometric shapes, but not that big, or big but semitransparent

Let's start with 2-5 characters and groups
